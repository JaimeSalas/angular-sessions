      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Lena, the truck's owner, had inherited the Airstream from her grandmother, who had spent years cooking up meals for the local community. 
        When her grandmother passed away, Lena decided to carry on the tradition but with a twist. 
        She wanted her food to do more than fill bellies—she wanted it to fill hearts.

        Each dish Lena served had a story. The grilled cheese was made with a blend of sharp cheddar and gooey mozzarella, 
        a recipe passed down from her grandmother’s childhood in a small town, where her great-grandfather would make the cheese in their barn. 
        The fried chicken had a secret seasoning mix that reminded people of their mother’s cooking, comforting and spicy, yet familiar. 
        And the cinnamon rolls? They were a labor of love, fluffy with a swirl of cinnamon that melted in your mouth, just like the ones 
        Lena used to bake with her grandmother every Sunday morning.
